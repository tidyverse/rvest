SelectorGadget is a JavaScript bookmarklet that allows you to interactively figure out what css selector you need to extract desired components from a page.

## Installation

To install it, open this page in your browser, and then drag the following link to your bookmark bar: <a href="javascript:(function(){var%20s=document.createElement('div');s.innerHTML='Loading...';s.style.color='black';s.style.padding='20px';s.style.position='fixed';s.style.zIndex='9999';s.style.fontSize='3.0em';s.style.border='2px%20solid%20black';s.style.right='40px';s.style.top='40px';s.setAttribute('class','selector_gadget_loading');s.style.background='white';document.body.appendChild(s);s=document.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');s.setAttribute('src','https://dv0akt2986vzh.cloudfront.net/unstable/lib/selectorgadget.js');document.body.appendChild(s);})();">SelectorGadget</a>.

## Use

To use it, open the page you want to scrape, then:

1.  Click the SelectorGadget entry in your bookmark bar.

2.  Click on the element you want to select.
    SelectorGadget will make a first guess at what css selector you want.
    It's likely to be bad since it only has one example to learn from, but it's a start.
    Elements that match the selector will be highlighted in yellow.

3.  Click on elements that shouldn't be selected.
    They will turn red.
    Click on elements that *should* be selected.
    They will turn green.

4.  Iterate until only the elements you want are selected.
    SelectorGadget isn't perfect and sometimes won't be able to find a useful css selector.
    Sometimes starting from a different element helps.

## Example

For example, imagine we want to find the names of the movies listed in `vignette("starwars")`.

```{r}
library(rvest)
html <- read_html("https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html")
```

1.  Start by opening <https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/starwars.html> in a web browser.

2.  Click on the SelectorGadget link in the bookmarks. The SelectorGadget console will appear at the bottom of the screen, and element currently under the mouse will be highlighted in orange.

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| fig-alt: >
    #|   A screenshot of the starwars vignette with an orange box drawn around
    #|   the top few lines of the page. SelectorGadget reports "no valid
    #|   path found"
    knitr::include_graphics("selectorgadget-hover.png", dpi = 144)
    ```

3.  Click on the movie name to select it. The element you selected will be highlighted in green. SelectorGadget guesses which css selector you want (`h2` in this case), and highlights all matches in yellow (see total count equal to 7 as indicated on on the "Clear" button).

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| fig-alt: >
    #|   A screenshot of the starwars vignette with an green box around 
    #|   the heading "Attack of the Clones". SelectorGadget reports that
    #|   a css selector of "h2" selects this element.
    knitr::include_graphics("selectorgadget-click.png", dpi = 144)
    ```

4.  Scroll around the document to verify that we have selected all the desired movie titles and nothing else. In this case, it looks like SelectorGadget figured it out on the first try, and we can use the selector in our R code:

    ```{r}
    html %>% 
      html_element("h2") %>% 
      html_text2()
    ```

Now let's try something a little more challenging: selecting all paragraphs of the movie intro.

1.  Start the same way as before, opening the website and then using the SelectorGadget bookmark, but this time we click on the first paragraph of the intro.

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| fig-alt: >
    #|   A screenshot of the starwars vignette with an green box around 
    #|   the paragraph that begins "There is unrest in the Galactic Senate"
    #|   Every other paragraph is coloured yellow.
    knitr::include_graphics("selectorgadget-too-many.png", dpi = 144)
    ```

2.  This obviously selects too many elements, so click on one of the paragraphs that shouldn't match. It turns red indicating that this element shouldn't be matched.

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| fig-alt: >
    #|   A screenshot of the starwars vignette with an green box around 
    #|   the paragraph that begins "There is unrest in the Galactic Senate"
    #|   and a red box around the sentence "Released: 2002-05-16". The
    #|   sentence giving the director is unhiglighted and everything
    #|   else is yellow. The discovered selector is ".crawl p".
    knitr::include_graphics("selectorgadget-remove.png", dpi = 144)
    ```

3.  This looks good, so we convert it to R code:

    ```{r}
    html %>% 
      html_elements(".crawl p") %>% 
      html_text2() %>% 
      .[1:4]
    ```

This is correct, but we've lost the connection between title and intro.
To fix this problem we need to take a step back and see if we can find an element that identifies all the data for one movie.
By carefully hovering, we can figure out that the `section` selector seems to do the job:

```{r}
films <- html %>% html_elements("section")
films
```

Then we can get the title for each film:

```{r}
films %>% 
  html_element("h2") %>% 
  html_text2()
```

And the contents of that intro:

```{r}
films %>% 
  html_element(".crawl") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% 
  writeLines()
```

This is a pretty common experience --- SelectorGadget will get you started finding useful selectors but you'll often have to combine it with other code.
